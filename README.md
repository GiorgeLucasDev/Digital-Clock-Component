This is a digital clock component project created by Giorge Lucas using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was created to test my knowledge of JavaScript DOM and to challenge myself.

## Description 📝

This project is a simple digital clock application that displays the current time in real-time. The user interface was designed using HTML and CSS, while the clock functionality was implemented using JavaScript.
